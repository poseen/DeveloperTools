<h1>ðŸ›  The Dev::Tools ðŸ–³</h1>
<p>This project is currently just a playground for me to learn Angular and Docker.</p>
<p>In the end it may become a docker image which will contain (and be extensible with) a lot of modules which can come handy in a day-to-day work of a developer, like JSON, HTML, SQL beautifier, custom code generators, and so on.</p>
<p>The reason behind this project is that in my day-to-day work I see many developers (yes, sometimes including me) who use random webpages in the internet when they want to make a generated SQL, HTML, XML, etc. text readable. Or they just want to code/decode a base64 encoded image or anything else binary. With these tools out there in the Internet wilderness you can never know if they store your input or not. This is why I wanted to create a toolset which will contain all my required tools and be as much offline as much as possible.</p>
<p>I know the usefulnes of a tool like this is really... hmm... oppinionable since we already have these tools: XML, JSON, SQL beautifier in Notepad++, base64 encoder/decoder in Total Commander, but I wanted to have these tools in one place, and also create my own tools (usually code or ID generators) for my actual assignments.</p>
